# README.md Generator

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a command-line generated, time efficient, high-quality README.md using node.js.  The user is prompted with a series of questions that will be added to their final generated README.  Questions include app/project description, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, licensing, and how to make contributions and report issues.
